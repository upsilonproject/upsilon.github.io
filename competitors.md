The word "competitor" is meant not in an arogrant tone - Upsilon doesn't have a
fraction of some of the contributions that just one of these other projects
have. The word "competititor" is meant like "other project", "alternatives to
upsilon", etc - just makes it easy to understand the context. 

This page lists other projects in the same space, and explains what Upsilon
does better (or worse) than those projects. If you generally want to know why
upsilon might work for you, see the [why](why) page.

## here does Upsilon overlap?
