* Totally Free and Open Source Software. 

### What sucks about upsilon project?

**Lots of things!**. Some parts are written in Java and PHP, there are some security holes and quite a few bugs at the moment. But this has been a labour of love for quite some time, but that's ok! These will be fixed over time and for sure new issues will be introduced. But if you think you'd like to help out, or just stay subscribed to updates, then please consider joining the [community](community) in some way.
