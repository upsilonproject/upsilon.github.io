Please say what you think about the Upsilon Project! ;) 

You can send your feedback via one of our [community](community) options, or if you're more technically-inclined, via our [project issue trackers](http://github.com/upsilonproject) for the relevant project.

When giving feedback, please bare these guidelines in mind;

* Speaking up is better than staying silent, the good, the bad and the ugly is good to know about.
* If you've not got a response, it's OK to ask for followups. 
* English only I'm afraid! 

There are several ways of giving feedback though, especially if it's more negative or something to improve;

* **Not useful**: The dashboard sucks.
* **More useful**: The dashboard sucks because widgets arn't in the right place.
* **Most useful**: The dashboard sucks because widgets cannot be placed in a specific location, can we have drag and drop?

Thanks for taking the time out of your day!
